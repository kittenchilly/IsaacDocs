**Content-Folder**{: .xmlInfo .green }: Placing this file in a content folder of a mod will add a new Costumes. See the Tutorial on "Adding Costumes" for more informations.

## Costume Reference Guide
Connor made a very handy table of all costumes currently available in the game. It contains their ID, Type, Priority, layer informations and a preview image for each costume.

These informations can be used to improve your workflow of creating new costumes, by knowing which costumes it might interfere with or what priority it should have.

## Anm2 Layer Structure
The order in which costumes are rendered is defined by their specific "layers" in their anm2 files. Each of the layers can only have one sprite rendered at a time. A costume may have pieces on multiple layers (for example, the face, third eye, and flame of "Spoon Bender" are all on separate layers).

**Layer names**

From bottom to top: glow < body < body{0..1} < head < head{0..5} < top0 < extra < back
